When I am encountering new material, my goal is to understand. This means seeking out new and varied explanations, reading and re-reading, and asking for help. Things that I understand, but do not practice, quickly leave my brain. Despite this, practice is still not something I am very interested in. Ultimately, my goal is to understand, not to practice. This blog is my practice.
