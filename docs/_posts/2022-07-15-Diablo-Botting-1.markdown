I have a problem when it comes to video games. I was diagnosed with tendinitis in my hand around 5 years ago. This has caused me to have to stop playing sometimes. Yes, Reader, I know. It is very sad. One of the worst gaming experiences with tendinitis is Diablo 2. The root of the problem is that Diablo 2 requires a large amount of repetitive clicking that can last for the entire duration of the session. Today, we will be starting a project to bot Diablo 2 (offline), that way I will never have to stop playing. 
When I decided to go through with this project idea, I wanted to effectively learn and practice a couple of skills that I deem valuable. We have three goals to accomplish by the end of this project:

Patching the Diablo binary in creative ways that allow for an interesting character

Editing the running memory of the Diablo process in creative ways that allow for an interesting character

Creating a bot to play the game on our behalf

With these goals I expect to learn and practice:

How to edit a binary

How to access a running processes memory

Python Automation magic

Let’s begin >:)

The first task was to create a very powerful character, but I took baby steps. Before I started messing with internal pointers or rewriting the code of certain abilities, I figured it would be reasonable to start with a max level character. Baby steps in this case would be editing the character save file to bypass all that pesky leveling. We want to create a level 99 character.

Let’s begin by creating a new character.
